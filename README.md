# Simple Trade Mod

A Simple Serverside trading mod.

To initiate a trade, run the command `/trade request <player-name>`\
The player will receive a message that allows them to either accept the trade or deny it.\
Accepting will immediately open the trade window. Unless the other player is currently in another gui.\
After placing all the trade offers, you and your trade partner must click on the lime terracotta to confirm the trade\
and lock the offerings. Should your trade partner change their offer after you've confirmed yours, it will unlock again, as a security measure.
